# Pocket Crew
3D platformer collectathon made in C++ and raylib.

## Building on Linux
Requires ``gcc`` for linux builds and ``mingw-w64-gcc`` for windows builds.


- To build for linux, run ``bash build.bash`` in the root of the repo.
- To build for windows, run ``bash buildWin.bash`` in the root of the repo.

## Notes
- Raylib 5.5 builds for Linux and Windows for x86_64 platforms are included in the /raylib directory along with their licenses. The raylib project can be found [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). I am not involved with this project.
