Hello! I'm Steven, nice to meet you.
Funny seeing a big fella like you here!
No offense.
I imagine you're stranded, right?
Not much but bugs and insects around here.
Hmmm... I have an idea to get you home!
We could make you a boat! A big one!
I'd need more bug-power though...
Maybe an ant or two.
You should scutter around and ask for help.
I'm sure there's smart some bugs out there!
Ones with degrees maybe.
I'll tag along.
I'm a great communicator!
I'll sweep them off their legs!
