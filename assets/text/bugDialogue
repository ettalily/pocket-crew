Hello! I'm Hoppenheimer, nice to meet you.
Funny seeing a big fellow like you here!
No offense intended.
There's just not many big people around here.
I imagine you're stranded, hmm?
Hmmm... I have an idea to help get you home!
We could make you a boat, a big one!
However, I'd need more bug-power...
Maybe an ant or two for the heavy lifting.
You should scutter around and ask for help.
I'm sure there's more smart bugs out there.
Other than myself, of course!
Ones with degrees preferably.
I'll join and explain things, don't worry.
I'm HOP-FUL things will work out just fine!
Ohoho!

Oh! I'm Catephrine. Hello!
Hello Hoppenheimer aswell.
Boats?...
Hmmmm...
Sounds like boots, I'm in!
With 16 feet you have to have nice shoes!
That's what I think at least...
If you even care...

I'm hungry. Will there be food?
Please?
